Just a simple cross-platform fullscreen Titanium (6.1.0.GA) 'classic' app boilerplate template with identical UI. Windows slide in and out from the right on both Android and iOS. Includes a shared view (with an example timer) which could contain something like audio player controls, etc. 

Pushing this up here as I often need to start a new app with this structure. 



**NOTE**: The Window slide in and out open/close animations were fixed in Titanium SDK 6.1.0 - https://jira.appcelerator.org/browse/TIMOB-24048
